"""Structural-orphan traceability lint.

This is a `work-loop` **skill script**: it lives at
`packs/core/.apm/skills/work-loop/scripts/lint-traceability.py` and projects to
every adapter's `.../skills/work-loop/scripts/`, the same way the sibling
`lint-spec-status.py` does. The agent runs it at the finish-time checklist; it
can also run as a fail-closed **CI gate** where a PR event and Python both
exist. It no-ops gracefully where Python is absent.

What it does — it generalizes `receive-brief`'s `lint-brief-coverage.py` (which
checks the single brief↔spec edge in one repo) to the full nine-layer product
chain **across repositories**:

    outcome → opportunity → capability → screen → action → service
            → contract → spec → component

It flags every **structural orphan** — a node that exists but asserts no
producer above it (a *backward* orphan, the scope-creep / unjustified-artifact
signal) or has no consumer below it (a *forward* orphan, the uncovered-intent
signal). The terminus is `component`, not `code`: `code` is the component's
content, not a separate node.

**Structure only.** Whether a node is parented to the *right* outcome (semantic
scope-creep) is never this lint's call — structural presence is mechanizable,
semantic correctness is not (the established traceability split — semantic
scope-creep is a human call at G1.5, never this lint's).

**The chain spans repos, because the loops do.** `work-loop` builds per module
(one repo, or one `packages/<c>/`); `discovery-loop` and the release loop work
within or across modules, so the upstream discovery artifacts and shared
contracts commonly live in a discovery / value-stream meta-repo. A
single working tree therefore sees only part of the chain. The crossing is
handled by **convention, not path**: every node carries a stable,
location-independent id (a marker slug, a `contract@version`, a Backstage
`kind:namespace/name`) and every cross-repo edge endpoint resolves to one of
three states — **local** (in this root), **satisfied-by-reference** (a
well-formed pointer resolving via a value-stream rollup / sidecar, pinned or
unpinned), or **unresolvable** (reported `unknown / not-yet-catalogued`, the
open-world federated-catalog posture — never fatal, never silently satisfied).

Two sources, one classifier:
  - When a recognized sidecar `traceability.json` (a `schema_version`-stamped
    `_state/` instance) is present it supplies the authoritative
    edge set. The schema *definition* is carried in `product-engineering`'s
    `discovery-loop` skill — this lint reads the produced instance by
    convention + the stamp, it never imports the definition.
  - When absent, the edge set is **derived from the local artifacts** (the
    standalone mode) via the declarative registry below.
  A matrix↔artifact disagreement is reported as **drift, warn-only** until the
  sidecar schema is pinned (deferred: sidecar-drift-hard-fail).

On the authoritative sidecar graph the lint also runs a **root→leaf reachability**
pass (`reachability_sidecar`): a node is reachable iff it is forward-reachable from
`root` AND can reach a clean terminus (a `leaf_kind` node or a rollup-resolved
`satisfied-by-reference` endpoint). A node off every root→leaf path is `UNREACHABLE`
(the disconnected-subtree finding the discovery-loop cascade backstop depends
on) — additive to, and non-overlapping with, the presence orphans. An
*unresolvable* cross-repo hop is **not** a clean terminus (the sidecar is untrusted
input — a forged out-edge must not silently green a stranded subtree); a node whose
only escape is such a hop is surfaced informationally, never fatal. Reachability is
sidecar-only — a standalone derived graph is legitimately partial / multi-root.

Exit codes:
  0 = clean / reported. Structural orphans and `UNREACHABLE` findings are
      informational in default mode; unresolvable cross-repo endpoints, the
      `reaches a leaf only via an unresolved cross-repo reference` finding,
      unpinned references, and drift are never fatal.
  1 = a hard violation — a dangling edge (a pointer to a missing local target,
      or malformed) or a cycle, **in every mode**; or, under `--strict`, any
      structural orphan or `UNREACHABLE` node (the convergence-/CI-gate enforcing
      "traceability closed"). `--strict` degrades gracefully where the
      producer `Discovery:` headers / `type:` markers are absent (a separate
      CONVENTIONS follow-on lands those).

No chain artifacts at all → exit 0 with no diagnostic (the
`lint-brief-coverage.py` no-brief precedent).
