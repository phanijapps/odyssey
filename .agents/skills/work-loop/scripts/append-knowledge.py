"""Appends one entry to docs/knowledge/patterns.jsonl — the canonical writer.

The knowledge base is line-delimited JSON, and both `\\u2014` and a literal `—`
are valid JSON, so an author reaching for `json.dumps(entry)` (whose
`ensure_ascii` defaults to True) silently drifts the file's encoding while
passing every gate. This script is the one path that always writes raw UTF-8,
so the question never arises. `lint-knowledge.py` catches anything written by
another route.

Safety shape, in the order it happens — the order is the design:

  1. Resolve the repo root from git, with GIT_DIR / GIT_WORK_TREE /
     GIT_COMMON_DIR / GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES stripped from the child
     environment. Those variables relocate what `rev-parse` answers, and a
     confinement root an attacker can move is not a confinement root.
  2. Confine ``--file`` to ``<root>/docs/knowledge`` — expanduser, resolve,
     *then* verify the prefix. The order matters: checking before resolution
     accepts a symlink that escapes at its real location (CWE-73, the depth
     that a bare ``..``-strip misses). Same shape as the repo's blessed helper,
     ``tools/hooks/session-start.py:_safe_override_path``.
  3. Validate every field value *before* anything is opened. Entries are
     replayed verbatim into every future agent session by session-start, so
     this is a durable-instruction channel: no ``Cc`` controls (an ESC would
     be replayed as an ANSI sequence), no ``Cf`` formatting characters except
     ZWJ/ZWNJ (bidi overrides and the Unicode Tag block encode arbitrary text
     at zero visual width — invisible in a diff, live in every session), no
     U+0085/U+2028/U+2029 (they break ``str.splitlines()``, which is how both
     readers parse the file), no lone surrogates, and length caps.
  4. Take an exclusive lock for the rest of the run. Steps 5-7 are a
     read-modify-write; without the lock two concurrent appends both allocate
     the same id and the second replace discards the first entry, while both
     callers are told their learning was recorded.
  5. Pre-lint the existing file so a knowledge base that was *already* broken
     is reported as such, rather than the caller's entry taking the blame. A
     non-existent target is not a failure — it is an empty file to create.
     Linting precedes reading so a file that is not valid UTF-8 gets the
     designed message instead of a traceback.
  6. Allocate the next id as max(existing) + 1. Gaps are fine; the linter
     enforces uniqueness, not density.
  7. Write the full new content to a temp file beside the target, restore the
     target's mode onto it (``mkstemp`` creates 0600, and ``os.replace`` would
     otherwise narrow a committed world-readable file invisibly to git).
  8. Lint the *temp* file, and only ``os.replace`` it over the target on
     success. There is no window in which a rejected entry is live on disk, so
     there is nothing to roll back.

    two lint subprocesses, so a holder legitimately takes about a second and a

    while still being bounded — the point is that it reports rather than
    spinning, not that it gives up quickly.

    wrong — it broke a lock once *the waiter* had waited `timeout`, and then
    unlinked whatever lock existed on the way out. Three processes ended up in
    the critical section at once, and the displaced holder's release deleted
    its successor's lock, cascading for the rest of the burst:

        is merely slow still holds it. Only a lock older than `stale_after` —
        far longer than this critical section's two subprocess spawns — is
        treated as abandoned, and the acquire is retried rather than assumed
        to have won the unlink race.
      - **Release only what we still own.** The lock carries a unique token;
