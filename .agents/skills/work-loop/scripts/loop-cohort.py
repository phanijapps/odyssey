"""loop-cohort — work-loop execution-state owner (Phase 1).

Single tool the work-loop skill calls for every deterministic state mutation:
phase termination checks, plan approval, review-finding fingerprints, and wave
scheduling. Phase-1 parallel verbs (worktree, dispatch-decision, auto-parallel)
are disabled — they exit non-zero without touching state.json.

Cross-platform: Python 3 stdlib only, `subprocess` for git, `os.replace` for
atomic writes, `pathlib` for paths. No shell, no bash, no PATH dependency.
