"""Cross-process advisory lock for a state-file read-modify-write.

A work-loop script, owned by this skill. Stdlib only — no ``agentbundle``
import, direct or lazy — so it works in adopter trees and user-scope installs
where nothing else is on the path. Its siblings load it by path
(``importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`` against ``SCRIPT_DIR``), not by
``import``, because a plain import does not resolve under the importlib-based
test harnesses.

``agentbundle`` has its own lock (``agentbundle/statelock.py``) for the
installer's ``state.toml``. That one is deliberately **not** shared with this
one: see ADR-0074. The two guard different files for different consumers, and
this copy is the stricter of the two — the hardening below is what the older one
lacks.

The problem it solves: writing a state file atomically (``mkstemp`` +
``os.replace``) does not make the *command-level* read-modify-write atomic. Two
concurrent verbs each load a stale snapshot and the second replace drops the
first's update — a lost update, not file corruption, but corruption of intent.
Worse for a state machine: both callers validate against the same snapshot, so
one is admitted a transition that should have been refused.

Hardening, each item a defect the older implementation still has:

* **Every** retry path checks the deadline and sleeps. The older loop's
  ``except FileNotFoundError: continue`` does neither, and ``Path.stat()``
  follows a symlink — so a dangling symlink at the lock path spins at ~98% CPU
  forever and the timeout never fires. Here the examine step uses ``os.lstat``
  and refuses any non-regular file outright: waiting cannot make it acquirable.
* **Reclaim and release key on inode identity AND the per-hold token.** Rename
  alone is not enough: contender B observes a stale lock; A reclaims it and
  creates a fresh one; B then renames *A's live lock* away and acquires — two
  holders. Inode identity alone is not enough either, because ext4 and tmpfs
  reuse inode numbers, so a successor's lockfile can land on the freed inode of
  the file being checked. Both together make a false match require reproducing a
  uuid4. A mismatched reclaim restores the file with ``os.link`` rather than
  ``rename``, since ``rename`` would silently replace — and so delete — a
  bystander's lockfile.
* **A holder that lost its lock says so** (``StateLockLost``) rather than
  unlinking a successor's file and exiting quietly. This is what protects the
  *state* rather than the file: a holder reclaimed mid-body must not report
  success, or the lost update is back with a green exit code.
* **No ``mkdir``.** Creating the lock's parent is safe only for a confined state
  path, and ``loop-cohort.py``'s spec-dir resolver does not confine to the repo
  root — so it would gain an arbitrary-directory-creation side effect on a path
  it then refuses.
* **Errors do not derive from ``OSError``.** Both callers carry broad
  ``except OSError`` / ``except Exception`` handlers around the regions that take
  this lock, so an ``OSError``-derived failure is one boundary-drift away from
  being swallowed into an unlocked write.

No symlink is created (the repo's no-symlink posture), no daemon, no heartbeat,
no third-party import."""
