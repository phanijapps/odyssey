description: Use this skill to orient at session start, check initiative queue state, or see what's ready to work on next. Reads workspace.toml and surfaces ready-to-start items, blocked items with reason, parallel candidates, and active signals. Triggers on "workspace status", "where am I", "orient me", "session start", "what's ready", "show the queue", "what's next", "what should I work on", "check workspace", or any cold-start orientation request. Offers to initialise workspace.toml if absent. Also reconciles and repairs workspace.toml drift — generates and applies repair plans for stale queue entries. Triggers on "clean up stale specs", "run repair-plan", "apply the workspace repair plan", "fix queue drift", "reconcile workspace", or any workspace repair or cleanup request.

# Skill: workspace-status

Read the local `workspace.toml` and surface the current queue state across all active initiatives. Run this at every session start — it replaces reading multiple product docs by hand.

## Output rendering

Status list — Lead each row with a status glyph — ● running, ✓ done, ○ idle, ⚠ blocked — status first, one item per line, labels aligned.
Table — When presenting several items that share the same fields, render a Markdown table. Cap at ~5 columns; beyond that, switch to a per-item detail list. Right-align numeric columns.
Diagram / flow — For relationships or flow, emit a fenced ```mermaid block (it renders in chat and artifacts). If the surface is terminal-only, fall back to an ASCII box-and-arrow sketch.
Progress — Report progress inline as done/total (e.g. 3/8). Only draw a bar if you're animating in a terminal.

## When to invoke

Any time you need to orient: which initiative is active, what specs are ready to start, what is blocked and why, what signals the strategist has flagged. Also the right skill if workspace.toml does not yet exist and you want to initialise it.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** — the backend uses `tomllib` (stdlib from 3.11). Confirm with `python3 --version` (macOS/Linux) or `python --version` (Windows). If Python is absent or below 3.11, the backend exits with a load error; install or upgrade before invoking this skill.
- **tomlkit** (for `repair-apply` only) — comment-preserving TOML writer. Detect: `python3 -c "import tomlkit"`. If absent, `repair-apply` exits 2 with `reason: "tomlkit_unavailable"` — surface to the user; install only with consent: `pip install tomlkit==0.15.1`. `repair-plan` does not require it.

## Procedure

### 1. Invoke the backend

Run the production backend via **argument vector** (the canonical and only safe invocation):

```
["<python>", "<skill-dir>/scripts/workspace_status.py", "status", "--root", "<repo-root>"]
```

The `status` subcommand runs a bounded scan (Type 2 + Type 3 only — no global spec walk). Use `reconcile` for a full audit that also finds untracked live specs (Type 1). Use `explain` to investigate a specific item. See **§1a. Subcommand guidance** below.

`<python>` is the Python 3.11+ interpreter available in your environment: `python3` on macOS/Linux; `python` on Windows. `<skill-dir>` is the directory where your installer placed this skill's files (i.e., the directory containing this SKILL.md). Passing the paths as **discrete arguments** prevents shell expansion of `$()`, backticks, `$VAR`, and other metacharacters — the values are never interpreted by a shell.

**Shell-string-only tools:** If your adapter cannot be configured to pass a discrete argument vector, use the shell-specific form below — or, for maximum portability, set the working directory to the repository root and pass `--root .`:

- **POSIX (bash/zsh):** `python3 '<skill-dir>/scripts/workspace_status.py' status --root .`
- **PowerShell:** `python '<skill-dir>/scripts/workspace_status.py' status --root .` (single-quoted strings are literal in PS; safe unless the path contains `'`)
- **cmd.exe:** `python "<skill-dir>\scripts\workspace_status.py" status --root .` (double-quoted path; safe unless the path contains `"`, `%`, or `!` — any of these requires the argv form)

Any path with special characters requires the argv form.

**Exit 1 — workspace.toml absent:** the JSON will contain `"workspace_present": false`. Offer to initialise — ask the user whether to create a blank file or bootstrap with their first initiative. A blank file emits the full schema-documented template:

```toml
# workspace.toml
#
# Declared-intent coordination artifact for this repo.
# Each initiative gets its own named section. Run `workspace-status` to surface
# ready items, blocked items, and active signals.
#
# Queue entries are strings (no deps) or inline objects {path/slug, needs}
# (with dependencies). `needs` uses queue-prefix notation:
#   "work:<path>"      — depends on a work queue entry
#   "shape:<slug>"     — depends on a shaping queue entry
#   "research:<slug>"  — depends on a research entry
#   "brief:<path>"     — depends on a brief queue entry
#   "backlog:<slug>"   — depends on a repo-level [backlog] item
# Cross-initiative deps prefix the initiative slug: "ini-002:work:spec/..."
#
# shaping_queue entry types: shape | research | strategy | signal | design
#   shape    → frame-intent (or frame-situation when PE pack is available)
#   research → desk-research-project-start (requires desk-research pack)
#   strategy → frame-situation (PE pack — M2); interim: frame-intent
#   signal   → no action; surfaces in "active context" section only
#   design   → experience-status (requires experience-design pack); fallback: journey-mapping
#
# The top-level [backlog] section (repo-durable open work not scoped to any
# active initiative) is distinct from a shaping_queue's `backlog` array.

["<initiative-slug>"]
name      = "<Initiative Name>"
status    = "active"      # active | paused | closed
milestone = "<milestone>"

["<initiative-slug>".work]
queue   = []  # ordered list of spec paths to build; earliest-first
active  = []  # currently in-progress
shipped = []  # completed

["<initiative-slug>".shaping_queue]
active  = []
backlog = []

[backlog]
open = []
```

**Exit 2 — unexpected error:** surface the stderr message and stop — do not proceed with partial data.

**Exit 0:** parse the JSON result. Key fields:

```
mode                             — active subcommand: "status" | "reconcile" | "explain"
scan.global_spec_scan_performed  — true only in reconcile mode (Type 1 walk performed)
scan.workspace_files_read        — always 1 (workspace.toml)
scan.declared_spec_files_read    — spec.md files read for declared entries (Type 2+3 reads)
scan.global_scan_spec_files_read — spec.md files read during global walk; 0 in status/explain
reconciliation.performed         — always true in status/reconcile (Type 2+3 always run)
reconciliation.complete          — true only in reconcile (all three types performed)
reconciliation.types_performed   — [2, 3] in status; [1, 2, 3] in reconcile
                                   (explain mode omits the reconciliation object entirely)
selector                         — normalized selector string (explain mode only)
selector_status                  — "matched" | "not_found" | "ambiguous" (explain mode only)
explained_item                   — item details when selector_status is "matched" (explain only)
matches                          — initiative slugs with colliding entries when "ambiguous" (explain only)
initiatives              — list of active initiatives (slug, name, status, milestone, brief_queue)
initiatives[].brief_queue — {executing, ready, draft} or null
work.ready     — list of ready-to-start build entries; each carries ini_slug and blocking_needs
work.blocked   — list of blocked build entries; each carries ini_slug and blocking_needs
work.active    — list of currently in-progress build entries; each carries ini_slug
work.shipped   — list of shipped build entries; each carries ini_slug
shaping.ready  — list of ready shaping entries (from active AND backlog); each carries ini_slug and blocking_needs
shaping.signals — list of active-context signal entries; each carries ini_slug
shaping.blocked — list of blocked shaping entries (backlog only); each carries ini_slug and blocking_needs
shaping.active_entries — list of all shaping_queue.active entries; each carries slug, ini_slug, and entry_type (signals included)
reconciliation.type1             — untracked live specs (empty in status/explain; 1 not in types_performed)
reconciliation.type2             — stale queue/active entries
reconciliation.type3             — prematurely-shipped entries
reconciliation.type2_cleanup_ops — cleanup operations per Type 2 finding
diagnostics.spec_files_read      — number of spec.md files examined (status + reconcile only)
```

### 1a. Subcommand guidance

| Subcommand | When to use | Type 1 walk | Writes |
|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| `status` (default) | Session start, queue check — fast bounded scan | No | — |
| `reconcile` | Full audit: find untracked live specs in addition to stale/premature entries | Yes | — |
| `explain --item <selector>` | Investigate a specific item (slug or `spec/` path) | No | — |
| `repair-plan` | Build a deterministic repair plan for Type 2 queue findings | Yes | `.workspace-repair-plan.json` |
| `repair-apply` | Apply a previously generated repair plan atomically | No | `workspace.toml` |

**`reconcile`** — use when you suspect specs have been approved or put in-progress without being added to `workspace.toml`. The Type 1 walk reads every `spec.md` in `docs/specs/` and reports any Approved/Implementing spec not listed in any initiative.

**`explain`** — pass a slug or `spec/` path to get the item's current classification, dependencies, blocking needs, and which downstream items would become unblocked if this item shipped. Lookup is restricted to **active initiatives' work queues** (queue/active/shipped); shaping items and items in paused or closed initiatives return `selector_status: "not_found"`.

**`repair-plan`** — runs a full reconciliation scan (Type 1+2+3) and builds a deterministic repair plan for all automatically-resolvable Type 2 queue findings: queue entries whose spec shows `Shipped` (moved to `[work].shipped`) or `Archived` (removed from `[work].queue`). Emits a JSON plan to stdout and writes it to `.workspace-repair-plan.json` (override with `--plan-file`). The plan includes a SHA-256 fingerprint of `workspace.toml` so that `repair-apply` can detect stale plans. Type 1 and Type 3 findings, and any Type 2 `active`-list entries, appear in `manual_findings` — they require human review. `Approved` entries are never touched automatically. Exit 0 on success (including empty plan); exit 1 if workspace.toml is absent; exit 2 if the plan file cannot be written (stdout is still emitted).

**`repair-apply`** — loads the plan file written by `repair-plan` (default `.workspace-repair-plan.json`; override with `--plan-file`), verifies the SHA-256 fingerprint against the current `workspace.toml`, and applies each operation atomically via `tempfile.mkstemp`. Re-reads each spec's `Status` from disk at apply time; skips the operation (with a `skipped` record in `per_operation`) if the status has changed since the plan was made. Requires `tomlkit` to preserve TOML comments; exits 2 if `tomlkit` is unavailable. The write is skipped entirely when `operations_applied == 0` (no stray temp files). Exit 0 on success or all-skipped; exit 2 for any structural error (fingerprint mismatch, plan not found, parse error, invalid schema).

### 1b. Repair workflow

Use `repair-plan` + `repair-apply` to deterministically clean up stale queue entries without manual `workspace.toml` editing:

```
# Step 1 — inspect the plan (no writes to workspace.toml)
["<python>", "<skill-dir>/scripts/workspace_status.py", "repair-plan", "--root", "<repo-root>"]

# Step 2 — review the plan JSON; then apply (--yes is required to confirm the write)
["<python>", "<skill-dir>/scripts/workspace_status.py", "repair-apply", "--root", "<repo-root>", "--yes"]
```

**When to use:** after `reconcile` or `status` shows Type 2 stale-queue findings and you want automated cleanup without manual editing. The two-step design lets you review the plan before committing.

**`--plan-file <path>`** — override the plan file location for both subcommands. The path must resolve inside `<repo-root>`; symlinks that escape the root are rejected (exit 2, `plan_file_outside_root`).

**`tomlkit` availability** — `repair-apply` requires `tomlkit` (comment-preserving TOML writer). If absent, `repair-apply` exits 2 with `reason: "tomlkit_unavailable"`; surface to the user and install only with consent: `pip install tomlkit==0.15.1`. See `## Prerequisites` above. `repair-plan` does not require it.

**`repair-apply` result JSON key fields:**

```
schema_version     — 1
mode               — "repair-apply"
applied            — true if write succeeded; false on any structural error
operations_applied — count of operations actually written (0 when all skipped or empty plan)
per_operation      — list of {path, applied, reason?} for all operations
reason             — error reason string when applied:false (top-level field, structural errors)
```

**Interpreting `per_operation`:** each entry records `"applied": true` (written) or `"applied": false` with a `reason`:
- `spec_status_changed` — spec Status changed between plan and apply; human review needed
- `spec_status_unreadable` — spec.md not found or Status field missing
- `initiative_not_found` — ini_slug absent from workspace.toml
- `entry_not_found_in_queue` — path no longer in the queue (already removed or never present)

**`.workspace-repair-plan.json` and temp files** — both are written inside the repo root. Add them to `.gitignore` to avoid accidental commits (the temp files are cleaned up automatically on success).

### 2. Surface results

**When `mode == "explain"`:** render the focused lookup result below and stop — skip §§3–5. The explain JSON omits `reconciliation`, `work`, `shaping`, and `diagnostics`; those fields must not be read.

- `selector_status: "matched"` → surface the `explained_item` object: path, slug, ini_slug, list, classification, blocking_needs, dependencies, downstream_unblocked
- `selector_status: "not_found"` → report the selector was not found in any active initiative's work queue (shaping items and items in paused/closed initiatives also return `not_found`)
- `selector_status: "ambiguous"` → list the initiative slugs in `matches` and ask which initiative the user is working in. The CLI does not accept an initiative-prefix qualifier — re-invoking `explain` with the same selector will still return `ambiguous`. Use `status` for context on the relevant initiative.

For status and reconcile modes only, continue:

**Type 1 audit notice:** when `1` is not in `reconciliation.types_performed` (status mode only), always render the following line unconditionally — even when reconciliation is otherwise clean (N = 0):

> _Type 1 scan not performed — run `reconcile` to also check for untracked live specs._

If the reconciliation block is non-empty (any type1/type2/type3 findings), output it first:

**Reconciliation:**

Let N = total count across all three finding types. When N > 0, output before the main sections; omit subsections with no entries; name the initiative for each stale/shipped entry (e.g. `[ini-002 work]`):

```
**Reconciliation** — N inconsistenc(y/ies) detected:

  Untracked live specs (Approved or Implementing, not in any initiative list):
  [Gate: render this subsection only when 1 is in reconciliation.types_performed.
   When absent: omit this subsection — the global Type 1 audit notice at the top
   of §2 already informs the user; do not emit a second notice here.]
  - `spec/<slug>` (Status: Approved) — add to [work].queue or run capture-work

  Stale queue/active entries (spec shows Shipped or Archived):
  - `spec/<slug>` in [ini-002 work].queue — Status: Shipped
  - `spec/<slug>` in [ini-002 work].active — Status: Archived

  Prematurely-shipped entries ([work].shipped, spec shows live status):
  - `spec/<slug>` in [ini-002 work].shipped — Status: Implementing
    Possible causes: (1) spec Status was not updated after shipping, or
    (2) the workspace.toml entry was moved before the work was done.
```

When Type 2 findings exist, build the cleanup offer using `reconciliation.type2_cleanup_ops`. For any Type 2 entry whose `list_name` is `active`, ask first: "Is `<path>` actively being worked on in this session?" — if the user says yes, **exclude all ops for that `(ini_slug, path)` pair** from the confirmed-operation set (both the active-list op and any queue-list op for the same path, to avoid partially applying a cleanup that leaves the path in both `active` and `shipped`). Build the _confirmed set_ (all ops except those excluded) before showing the offer. Then append:

```
Stale entries found — clean up now?
  Shipped entries move to [work].shipped (bare string, `needs` dropped).
  Archived entries are removed from [work].queue or [work].active.
  Reply Y to apply, or edit workspace.toml manually.
```

**Cleanup write — after Y confirmation (Type 2 only):**

Apply only the _confirmed set_ of operations (do not re-read `type2_cleanup_ops`). Each op describes:
- `ini_slug` — initiative to modify
- `source_list` — list to remove the entry from (`queue` or `active`)
- `target_list` — list to add it to (`shipped`) or `null` (Archived: remove only)
- `path` — the entry path
- `written_form` — TOML source literal for text insertion (Shipped only; e.g. `"spec/foo"` with surrounding quotes)

When appending to `[work].shipped`, deduplicate by `path`: skip the append if the path is already present (a path in both `queue` and `active` produces two ops; apply the source-list removal for each but append at most once).

Use a comment-preserving write — targeted text insertion or `tomlkit`; never a `tomllib` + `tomli_w` round-trip (strips comments).
- **Text insertion:** append `written_form` as-is (it is already a correctly-quoted TOML string literal, including surrounding `"` characters).
- **`tomlkit` structured API:** append `path` (the raw string value); `tomlkit` handles quoting automatically. Do not pass `written_form` to `tomlkit` — it would persist the surrounding quote characters as part of the path value.

**Main output sections:**

Format output in four sections (omit sections with no entries):

---

**Active initiatives:** (for each entry in `initiatives[]`)
`<ini-slug>` — `<name>` (milestone: `<milestone>`)
- **Brief queue** (from `initiatives[].brief_queue`; omit when `null`): Executing: `<executing>` (or "none") · Ready: N item(s) · Draft: N item(s)

**Active context — signals** _(ongoing; do not need action):_
- `<slug>` (`signal`) — no action needed; informs shaping decisions

**Ready to start:**
- `[build]` `<path>` — run `work-loop` on `docs/specs/<path>/`
- `[shape]` `<slug>` (`shape`) — run `frame-intent`
- `[shape]` `<slug>` (`research`) — run `desk-research-project-start`
- `[shape]` `<slug>` (`strategy`) — route through `frame-situation` (PE pack — M2); if not yet available, run `frame-intent` as interim
- `[shape]` `<slug>` (`design`) — run `experience-status` (requires experience-design pack); fallback: `journey-mapping`
- `[brief]` `<path>` (Ready) — run `receive-brief` on `docs/product/briefs/<path>.md`

**Parallel candidates:** _(all of the above with no inter-dependencies can start concurrently)_

**Blocked:**
- `<path>` — waiting on `<needs-entry>` (status: `<queued|in-progress>`)

  Resolve the status from JSON: for each entry in `blocking_needs`, strip the queue-prefix to get the slug/path, then branch on the prefix. **For same-initiative deps** (no `ini-NNN:` prefix), scope every lookup to the blocked entry's own `ini_slug`; only entries matching that `ini_slug` count. For cross-initiative deps, scope to the named initiative instead.
  - `work:` — scope to blocked entry's `ini_slug`: filter `work.active`, `work.ready`, `work.blocked` by `ini_slug == owning-ini`. Path in filtered `work.active` → `in-progress`; in filtered `work.ready` or `work.blocked` → `queued`; else → omit.
  - `shape:` — scope to `ini_slug` as above; use `shaping.active_entries` filtered to `ini_slug == owning-ini`: if a matching entry with `slug == dep_slug` is found → `in-progress` (signals included); else → omit.
  - `research:` — research deps block while the item is in `shaping_queue.backlog`; backlog items appear in `shaping.ready` or `shaping.blocked` — filter both by `ini_slug == owning-ini`: if dep slug found → `queued`; else → omit.
  - `brief:` — scope to the owning initiative's `brief_queue` only (filter `initiatives[]` by `slug == owning-ini`, since `initiatives[]` carries `slug` not `ini_slug`): if path in `brief_queue.draft` → `queued`; if in `brief_queue.executing` → `in-progress`; else → omit.
  - Cross-initiative prefix (e.g. `ini-002:work:spec/foo`) — strip the `ini-NNN:` prefix to get the named initiative; resolve the remainder as above using that initiative's `ini_slug`.
  - Not found by any path (dependency belongs to a paused initiative) → omit the status annotation.

**Needs-resolution modes (`analyze_bounded` / `is_need_satisfied`):** `workspace_status()` (used by workspace-mcp) calls `analyze_bounded(autonomous_dispatch=True)`, which applies conservative semantics. All other callers use `autonomous_dispatch=False` (default, human-session semantics). The difference:

| Need | `autonomous_dispatch=False` (default) | `autonomous_dispatch=True` |
|------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `shape:<slug>` | Not in active → satisfied (graduated or never existed) | Not in active AND not in backlog → unsatisfied (never planned). In backlog but not active → satisfied (planned, not yet started). |
| `research:<slug>` | Not in backlog as type "research" → satisfied (done or never needed) | Not in backlog as type "research" → **satisfied** (same as human mode — completed research is removed from backlog; absent is indistinguishable from completed). |
| `work:`, `brief:`, `backlog:`, cross-initiative | Unchanged | Unchanged |

Intentional asymmetry: `shape:` in backlog = satisfied in autonomous mode (presence confirms the human scheduled it). `research:` uses the same logic in both modes: absent from backlog = satisfied (done or never needed); present in backlog as type "research" = unsatisfied (still pending). The autonomous-mode distinction does not apply to `research:` needs.

**Closeout check:** For each initiative in `initiatives[]`, filter `work.ready`, `work.blocked`, `work.active`, and `work.shipped` by that initiative's `ini_slug`. Also check `reconciliation.type2` for any entry with that `ini_slug`. Gate closeout on all of: (1) filtered ready + blocked + active are empty, (2) no type2 findings for that initiative, (3) `initiatives[i].queue_empty` is `true` — a path in both `queue` and `shipped` is excluded from the classifier's ready/blocked output and may have no type2 finding, so the raw queue emptiness flag is the authoritative check, (4) filtered shipped is non-empty → surface: "`<ini-slug>`: all specs shipped — ready to close out? Run closeout to remove this section (git history preserves the record)."

**Findings:** Read `docs/product/findings/rfc-candidates.md` and `docs/product/findings/roadmap-intents.md` if they exist. Count non-header rows in each (a non-header row is any `|…|` line after the header separator row — the `|---|...|` line of dashes).

- **When either file has data rows:** output a `**Findings:**` section with both tables printed inline — paste each file's full markdown table (column header row + separator + data rows) under a sub-label (`RFC candidates:` / `Roadmap intents:`). If one file is absent or has no data rows, output its sub-label followed by `_(empty)_`.
- **When both are empty or absent:** emit a single line: `0 rfc candidates · 0 roadmap intents — both registers empty`

**Backlog:** when `[backlog].open` in `workspace.toml` is non-empty, render:

```
**Backlog** — N open item(s):
- `[shape]` `<slug>` — <first # comment line above the entry>
- `[build]` `<slug>` — <first # comment line above the entry>
  ...
```

Each entry is prefixed with its room: `[shape]` when the entry carries a `type` field (shaping work); `[build]` when it does not (build work). To extract the first comment line: read `workspace.toml` as text; for each entry in `[backlog].open`, find the nearest `# ` comment line immediately preceding `{slug = "<slug>"}`. Use the comment text (without the leading `# `) as the item's summary. If no comment line is present, omit the summary and render just the slug. Omit this section entirely when `[backlog].open` is empty or absent.

---

### 3. Skill prompts by type

When surfacing shaping_queue entries, append the right skill invocation based on what's installed:

| Entry type | Skill to suggest |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `shape` (default) | `frame-intent` (available now); `frame-situation` (M2, when available) |
| `research` | `desk-research-project-start` (requires desk-research pack) |
| `strategy` | route through `frame-situation` (PE pack — M2); if not yet available, run `frame-intent` as interim |
| `signal` | no action — surface in "active context" section only |
| `design` | `experience-status` (requires experience-design pack); if experience-design is not installed: `journey-mapping` |

If the required pack is not installed, surface: "requires `<pack-name>` pack — install to work this item."

### 4. Missing fields

`workspace.toml` evolves: older entries may lack a `type` field (treat as `shape`), a `milestone` field (omit from output), or a `parent` field (omit). Never fail on missing optional fields.

### 5. Next-actions

Using the JSON data from Step 1 — do not re-read `workspace.toml` or recompute the DAG:

**5a. Resolve choices**

From the JSON result:

- `active_spec` = first entry in `work.active` (if any)
- `next_queue` = first entry in `work.ready` (JSON field, already resolved; first in list order)
- `unblocked` = all entries in `work.ready`
- `next_shape` = first entry in `shaping.ready` whose `entry_type` is not `signal` AND for which `shaping.active_entries` contains an entry matching all of `slug`, `ini_slug`, and `entry_type` (a signal named `x` in active does not make a non-signal `x` in ready count as active); fall back to the first `shaping.ready` non-signal entry with no such full match (backlog-ready)

**Path resolution:** entries in `work.ready`, `work.active`, etc. carry a `path` field (e.g. `"spec/m1-workspace-core"`). Strip the `spec/` prefix to get the slug; use `docs/specs/<slug>/` for file-system commands.

**5b. ASCII dependency graph (when ≥2 unblocked work items)**

If `len(unblocked) ≥ 2`, render the following block _before_ the numbered choices:

```
Work queue — parallel opportunities:

  <slug-A>  [ready]
  <slug-B>  [ready]
  <slug-C>  [blocked by <dep-slug>]
```

- Right-pad the slug column to the longest slug for alignment. Use the bare path (with `spec/` prefix preserved) for both `[ready]` and `[blocked by]` rows — e.g. `spec/alpha [ready]` and `spec/gamma [blocked by spec/alpha]`.
- Entries in `work.ready`: annotate `[ready]`.
- Entries in `work.blocked`: annotate `[blocked by <dep-slug>]`, where `<dep-slug>` is the first entry in that item's `blocking_needs` with the queue-prefix domain stripped.

**5c. Harness detection and parallel-session offer (when graph rendered)**

When the graph was rendered, offer a parallel-session choice as the **first** numbered slot. Check whether `--bg` appears in `claude --help` output (if a shell/command tool is available):

- **`--bg` found:** emit a numbered choice listing `claude --bg "work-loop docs/specs/<slug>/"` for each parallel-ready root node.
- **`--bg` absent or no shell tool available:** emit a numbered choice with prose instructions for each parallel-ready root node (no automated spawn).

**5d. Numbered choices**

Emit the following choices in order. Omit any whose source is empty; renumber sequentially. The parallel-session offer from 5c (when present) occupies the first slot and the remaining choices follow.

- **Active spec:** `work-loop docs/specs/<slug>/` — continue active spec. Present when `active_spec` is non-empty.
- **Next queue item:** `work-loop docs/specs/<slug>/` — next unblocked queue item. Present when `next_queue` is non-empty.
- **First shaping item:** skill command per Step 3 routing table for the entry's type. Present when `next_shape` is non-empty. If the required pack is not installed, emit `requires \`<pack-name>\` pack — install to work this item` instead of the skill command.
- **Start new work (always — final choice):** `new-spec` · `new-rfc` · `new-adr` · `capture-work`
