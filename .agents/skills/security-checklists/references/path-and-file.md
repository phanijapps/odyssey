## Spec-stage (proactive control)

At design time, the control is **confinement, not just traversal-blocking** —
the spec should require that resolved paths stay within a designated root
(canonicalize-then-verify-prefix), which is the CWE-73 depth, rather than the
shallower "reject `..`" (CWE-22). Name the allowed root and the rejection
behavior as criteria (ASVS 5.0 V12.1).

## Implementation checks

- `hybrid` **Path traversal (CWE-22).** Input containing `..`, absolute paths,
  or encoded separators reaching a file operation. A SAST taint rule finds the
  sink; you judge whether the fix actually confines.
- `reason` **Confinement (CWE-73) — the deeper miss.** Even with `..`
  stripped, the resolved real path must be verified to live under the intended
  root *after* canonicalization (resolve symlinks first, then check the
  prefix). Stripping `..` without a post-resolution prefix check is the gap
  that scanners and shallow fixes both miss.
- `reason` **Symlink escape.** A path that resolves through an attacker-placed
  symlink can leave the root; resolve links before the boundary check, and
  refuse to follow links into untrusted trees.
- `reason` **Tree-walk confinement (`os.walk`, 4 axes).** When code recurses
  a directory tree, four axes all must hold:
  - **(a) NTFS junctions (Windows).** `followlinks=False` does NOT stop
    `os.walk` from descending NTFS junction points — `os.path.islink()`
    returns `False` for them (CPython #23407). Guard: use
    `entry.is_junction()` (Python ≥ 3.12) or verify
    `resolved.is_relative_to(root)` after `resolve()` on every child dir.
  - **(b) Visited-set timing.** Add the resolved current directory to the
    visited set **before** processing filenames, not after. A sibling
    junction pointing to the same real dir passes the child-prune check
    before the target is recorded, so its content is processed twice.
  - **(c) Path / slug derivation from alias.** Derive output paths or
    catalogue slugs from the **resolved** canonical path, not the
    unresolved `dirpath`. An alias that sorts before its real target is
    processed first; its unresolved name becomes the slug, making the
    real entry appear untracked.
  - **(d) `RuntimeError` from circular symlinks.** `Path.resolve()`
    raises `RuntimeError` (not `OSError`) for symlink loops on Python
    3.11–3.12 (CPython #109187; PR #109192 not merged as of 3.12).
    Catch `(OSError, RuntimeError)` in both the current-directory guard
    and any child-pruning `resolve()` call.
- `reason` **Cross-format value encoding.** When values serialised in one
  format are reused in another, validate the **target** format's constraints
  independently:
  - **(a) Non-BMP characters: JSON → TOML / YAML.** `json.dumps` with the
    default `ensure_ascii=True` encodes non-BMP characters as surrogate pairs:
    U+1F600 (😀) becomes `\uD83D\uDE00` — two `\uXXXX` escapes — in the JSON
    string. These escape sequences are valid JSON but **invalid** in TOML string
    literals — TOML v1.1 requires Unicode scalar values, and U+D800–U+DFFF are
    not. Emit UTF-8 directly or use a format-aware helper.
  - **(b) `json.dumps` NaN / Infinity.** Python's `json.dumps` silently emits
    `NaN` / `Infinity` for IEEE 754 specials by default (`allow_nan=True`),
    violating RFC 8259. Pass `allow_nan=False` whenever the consumer or a
    downstream parser requires strict JSON.
- `reason` **Zip-slip / archive extraction.** Each entry's destination must be
  validated to stay under the extraction root; an entry named `../../etc/...`
  writes outside it. Reject absolute and traversing entry names.
- `reason` **Upload handling.** Don't trust the client-supplied filename or
  content-type for storage path or execution decisions; generate the stored
  name, and store outside any executable/served root unless intended.

## Established-helper bypass

Path confinement is the canonical "rolled its own" trap. Resolve the repo's
sanctioned path-confinement / safe-join helper and flag any change that builds
a path with raw string joins or a bare `..`-strip instead of calling it — the
blessed helper is where canonicalize-then-verify-prefix is done correctly,
once.
