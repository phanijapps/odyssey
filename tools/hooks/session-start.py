"""Session-start hook: prints knowledge-base entries from
docs/knowledge/patterns.jsonl as a context block, then nudges the
adapter when there are pending packs to adapt.

Pure-stdlib Python port of session-start.sh. Native-Windows-parity
companion of the bash version: same env vars, same arguments, same
exit codes, same stdout/stderr shape.

Optional argument: --scope <path-or-glob>
  When set, only entries whose stored `scope` glob *covers* the
  given path are printed (e.g. --scope packages/auth/server.ts
  returns entries scoped to packages/auth/**, packages/**, and the
  repo-wide *). Without --scope, every entry is printed.

Output goes to stdout; missing or empty knowledge file produces no
output and exits 0. Malformed lines are skipped with a one-line
warning to stderr (so the rot is visible) and do not abort the hook.
Wiring lives in each tool's hook surface (Claude Code:
.claude/settings.json; see tools/hooks/README.md).

Fixture mode:
  KNOWLEDGE_FILE=<path>     read a different knowledge file
  ADAPT_REPO_MARKER=<path>  override repo-scope marker
                            (default: repo_root/.adapt-install-marker.toml)
  ADAPT_USER_MARKER=<path>  override user-scope marker
                            (default: ~/.agentbundle/.adapt-install-marker.toml)

Session-start hook. Prints the adapt-to-project nudge.

Knowledge entries are NOT printed at session start. They are captured
by agents during the work-loop and are evidence, not instructions — and
whatever this hook prints lands in the model's context before the user's
first prompt, on start, resume, clear, compact and fork. Replaying
unreviewed, self-authored prose there grants it prompt authority no
review step ever agreed to. Pass --show-knowledge to render the block
deliberately, for curation.

Usage:
  session-start.py [--show-knowledge [--scope <path-or-glob>]]
  session-start.py --help

Optional argument: --scope <path-or-glob>
  When set, only entries whose stored `scope` glob *covers* the
  given path are printed (e.g. --scope packages/auth/server.ts
  returns entries scoped to packages/auth/**, packages/**, and the
  repo-wide *). Without --scope, every entry is printed.

Output goes to stdout; missing or empty knowledge file produces no
output and exits 0. Malformed lines are skipped with a one-line
warning to stderr.

    resolution — all of which are CWE-73 "external control of file name". The
