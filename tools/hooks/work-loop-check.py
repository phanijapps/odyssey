"""work-loop activation hook: prints a per-prompt reminder to use the
work-loop skill for non-trivial work.

Wired to the per-prompt event of each tool's hook surface — Claude Code
`UserPromptSubmit`, the Codex equivalent in `.codex/hooks.json`, and the
Copilot / Cursor / Gemini equivalents. Kiro IDE gets the same nudge via a
companion `promptSubmit` hook that carries the *same* instruction as a
prompt (the IDE drops hook-wiring and `runCommand` does not feed the
agent), so keep the two messages semantically aligned (both must mention
`work-loop`). See `tools/hooks/README.md` § Wiring for what lands where.

Pure-stdlib, input-free: prints a fixed reminder to stdout and exits 0.
It deliberately does not parse the prompt or classify triviality — that
judgment is the agent's, governed by the work-loop skill's own
"When this skill applies". Reading no stdin/env/files keeps it off every
security boundary.
