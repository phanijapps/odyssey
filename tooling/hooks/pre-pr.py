"""Pre-PR hook (adopter-facing): the work-loop's mechanical termination
check, plus a place to wire *your* project's gate.

Most agent tools fire no pre-PR / pre-push event, so wire this via a Git
``pre-push`` hook (``.git/hooks/pre-push``) or run it by hand before opening
a PR — the same way regardless of which agent tool you use:

    python tools/hooks/pre-pr.py

What it runs:
  - ``lint-knowledge.py`` over ``docs/knowledge/patterns.jsonl`` — the
    knowledge base the work-loop's Capture-learnings step appends to. The
    file is yours and the gate that validates it ships with it, so there is
    nothing to wire. Skipped cleanly when the file is absent.
  - ``loop-cohort.py check <spec-dir>`` for each ``docs/specs/*/state.json``,
    in ``--phase implement`` and ``--phase review`` — the work-loop's
    iteration/stasis caps. The script ships with the work-loop skill; this
    hook finds it under whichever skills directory your agent tool installed
    into (``.claude/``, ``.agents/``, ``.kiro/`` …) — same for
    ``lint-knowledge.py`` above. Skipped cleanly when there are no active
    specs (or the work-loop isn't installed).

It deliberately runs **none** of the source project's own artifact linters —
those enforce that project's conventions on its own tree and
don't apply to your repo. Wire your project's lint/typecheck/test commands
into the stub below instead (or let the ``adapt-to-project`` skill do it).

This hook degrades gracefully: a missing tool is a skip with a notice, never
a hard failure.
